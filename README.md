- Media uploads for lessons and assignments via integrated Cloudinary storage (supports videos and documents)
- Assignment workflow, enabling learners to submit work and receive feedback/grades from teaching staff or admins
- Automated scheduling for live lessons using Google Meet, including instant access links
- Interactive chat functionality within courses, supporting real-time conversation
- Administrative dashboard for managing users and educational content, reviewing and removing inappropriate submissions or data
- Dynamic interface tailored to each role (learners can join and submit, instructors/admins handle course setup, grading, and live scheduling)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup (`/server`)

```bash

cdserver


npminstall

```

#### Setup the environment variable

```bash

cp.env.example.env

```

#### This is create the .env with this

```env

MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/<databaseName>?retry

JWT_SECRET=mystrongsecretkey123

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=


# (Optionally for auto Google Meet):

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5002/api/google/oauth/callback/

GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=

GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=primary

PORT= 5002


# frontend url

ALLOWED_ORIGIN1=-your-vercel-url

ALLOWED_ORIGIN2= http://localhost:5173/

```

#### Run the server

```bash

npmstart

```

### Frontend Setup (`/client`)

```bash

cdclient


npm install



```

#### setup for the environment

```env

# If you deploy on the vercel then insert the render url here, not the localhost


VITE_API_URL=your-backend-url

```

## Setup using the Docker

Type the command in the main root that is the LearnEase

##### Regular startup

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

##### First time / after changes to Dockerfile or package.json

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

What’s implemented
	- Automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions
	•	Backend test suite with 5 test cases
	•	Tests executed using:
    ```
      npm test
    ```

Pipeline Behavior
	•	On every push / pull request to the main branch:
	•	Backend dependencies are installed
	•	All test cases are executed
	•	Syntax and runtime errors are checked

Failure Handling (Important)
	•	If any test or syntax check fails:
	•	Deployment is blocked
	•	Previously deployed version remains live
	•	Broken code is never deployed
	•	Failure notifications are sent via GitHub email alerts

Success Flow
	•	All tests pass
	•	Backend is deployed automatically
	•	Frontend remains uninterrupted

This ensures zero-downtime deployments and protects production from broken builds.

## Project Layout

-`/server` — Express backend, Mongo models, controllers, routes, configs

-`/client` — React frontend (Vite + TailwindCSS), API helpers, routing, context

- Key env files: `server/.env`, `client/.env` (git-ignored)

## Key Screens

- Login/Register (all roles)
- Course Catalog (students: enroll)
- Instructor Dashboard (manage courses, lectures, assignments, live schedule)
- Admin Dashboard (manage users/courses/content)
- Student Assignment Submissions (with due-date/grade/feedback logic)
- Chat (real-time)
- Live Class: Google Meet auto creation for scheduled lectures

## Additional Notes

- All uploads are via Cloudinary; configure credentials for full video/file support.
- To use Google Meet auto-scheduling, you must set up a Google Cloud project/OAuth and provide the required variables.
- User roles are 'student', 'instructor', 'admin'; controls and visibility change with role.
- All sensitive data is kept out of source—check `.gitignore` for .env handling.
